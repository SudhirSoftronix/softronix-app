    <string name="faq"> &lt;B&gt;Why one is not allowed to be a donor before attaining the age of 18 years? &lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;
Physiologically there is no harm in donating blood in the early age. The reason is legal, 18 being the age of consent in our country.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;
 &lt;B&gt;What if  the person from which I want blood has already donated blood in recently passes days? &lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;
we are providing the previous  date  of  donation of the donor. So if he has donated blood in the  passed three months and  no other  donor is  available  of  same blood  type ,then u can contact  to other blood bank  whose  details  are  mentioned  in our  app.
&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt; &lt;B&gt; Why three months interval has been stipulated  though donated blood is  recuperated within  28 days? &lt;/B&gt;
&lt;BR/&gt;As an additional precautionary measure for safety of donor.
&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt; &lt;B&gt; Is any  medical  history checked before registering the person as a blood donor? &lt;/B&gt;
&lt;BR/&gt;ctually any person who wish to donate blood can register as a donor to our app. As soon as he becomes a donor ,we verify that he is not suffering with any serious disease (malaria,jaundice, HIV) from his medical records from our blood bank.</string>
